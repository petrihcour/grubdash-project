# GrubDash

Welcome to GrubDash, a backend project consisting of setting up an API and building out specific routes for the frontend application. 

## Project Overview

### Context and Purpose


GrubDash serves as a practice and learning platform, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete specific food dishes and orders. The primary goals of this project include honing skills in building APIs with complex validation and demonstrating proficiency in various backend development aspects.

### Research and Use Case

The project is designed to provide hands-on experience in:
- Running tests from the command line.
- Implementing common middleware packages.
- Handling requests through defined routes.
- Accessing relevant information via route parameters.
