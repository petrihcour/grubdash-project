# GrubDash

Welcome to GrubDash, a backend project consisting of setting up an API and building out specific routes for the frontend application. 

GrubDash is a full-stack application website that allows people to create, read, update, and delete specific food dishes and orders. 

## Project Highlights

- **Purpose**: GrubDash is a project intended for practice and learning. It provides an opportunity to build APIs with complex validation. I demonstrated the ability to: 
    - Run tests from the command line.
    - Use common middleware packages.
    - Receive requests through routes.
    - Access relevant information through route parameters.
    - Build an API following RESTful design principles.
    - Write custom middleware functions.
- **Tech Stack**: I used Express to bring the backend of GrubDash to life.
